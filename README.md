# DeepErase
- DeepErase is a U-net-like tensorflow sementic segmenation model removing artifacts (lines, boxes, spurious words) from text images extracted from documents. The cleansing of the artifacts enhances OCR performance over the image extractions.

### Abstract
- We present a [method](https://github.com/yikeqicn/DeepErase/tree/master/src/DataFactory) to programmatically generate artiﬁcial text images with realistic-looking artifacts, and use them to train the U-net-like model in a totally unsupervised manner.
- The U-net-like model was trained in two modes:
  - [Standalone training](https://github.com/yikeqicn/DeepErase/tree/master/src/CleaningStandaloneModel): 
  - [Joint training with downstream Recognition model](https://github.com/yikeqicn/DeepErase/tree/master/src/CleaningRecognitionJointModel):
